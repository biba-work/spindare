# Spindare 🌀 `v0.37.1-pre-alpha`

**The Anti-Scroll Social Experiment.** Spindare is a reaction-algorithm-based platform designed to turn digital intent
into physical action. Built by a tight-knit team of three, we are redefining social connection
through the "Active Reveal" system.

> **Status:** Internal Pre-Alpha (Closed Testing).
> **Transitioning:** Moving from Expo Go to Native Standalone Builds.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

Spindare isn't a gallery; it’s a gauntlet. We believe social media should make you *feel* the world around you, not just the glass in your hand.

### 🎡 The Cycle

1. **The Spin:** AI-driven challenges optimized for your "DNA" (Character & Interests).
2. **The Action:** Complete the challenge. Take the photo. Write the reflection.
3. **The Unlock:** The community feed remains **LOCKED** until you finish your first Daily Spin. No participation, no consumption.
4. **The Reaction:** Engage with others through three distinct emotional pillars: **Felt**, **Thought**, and **Intrigued**.
